Notes &amp; implementations of the code within Jeremy Gibbons' ``Design Patterns as Higher-Order Datatype-Generic Programs''

+ A simple demonstration of the claims for the Haskell `Either` datatype in Java.

+ Then the iterator pattern for multibranching “rose” trees is presented in Java;
  taking more than 30 lines.

+ The breadth-first preorder is also presented in Haskell in essentially one line.
